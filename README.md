# Drilling-Data-Analysis

We will be utilizing 10,000â€™ of drilling data to implement an algorithm that will detect whether the mode of drilling is sliding or rotating. In order to do this we will be ingesting data from excel that will be categorized into the different drilling parameters utilizing python data frames. We will then pass the data through our algorithm to determine the drilling mode being performed and then display that data on a custom UI. This will be a more basic version of the algorithm that is being designed by the company as it is not utilizing machine learning, but it will still demonstrate the end goal of detection and display of the rig state.

## Requirements

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher. The following Python libraries are used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `openpyxl` (for working with Excel files)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wellatleastitried/Drilling-Data-Analysis
   cd Drilling-Data-Analysis
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > **Note**: It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts:
   > ```bash
   > python -m venv venv  # On Windows: py -m venv venv
   > source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   > pip install -r requirements.txt
   > ```

## Execution

To run this program, simply run the UI.py file:
```bash
python3 UI.py  # On Windows: py UI.py
```
## Notice

This project was a part of a group project for Software Engineering.
